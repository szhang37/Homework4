Computer Graphics HW4

In this assignment you will animate motions for an articulated humanoid figure. You will be given an articulated 3D model and sets of keyframes specifying the orientations of articulated joints at specific time steps. Your job is to interpolate the keyframes smoothly over a time interval so that the articulated figure performs animated actions (e.g., walks, dances, etc.).
