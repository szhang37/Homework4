            <td><span>The code you receive already parses apart the information in the .key files and makes the appropriate calls in the RayWindow::IdleFunction (in Ray/rayWindow.[h/cpp]) to update the values of the parameters. In order to obtain animations, modify the ParameterSamples::setCurrentValue (in Util/parameterSamples.todo.inl) method to set the value of ParameterSamples::currentValue by linearly interpolating the samples. You should assume that the value of the interpolation parameter, t, is always between 0 and 1.</span></td>

            <td>(2)</td>
            <td><span>The default factorization of the transformation samples read in from a .key file is as 4x4 matrices. Consequently, even if the samples are rotations, interpolation can introduce unwanted scaling (as in the runner's legs in Data/act/test.ray). Modify the code to support parametrization of rotations using Euler angles. To do this, you will need to implement the code in the constructor Matrix3D::Matrix3D(const Point3D& eulerAngles) (in Util/geometry.todo.cpp) which generates a 3x3 rotation matrix from a triplet of Euler angles. Recall that the three Euler angles define a rotation which is the product of a rotation about the x-axes, multiplied on the right by a rotation about the y-axes, multiplied on the right by a rotation about the z-axes. 
You will also need to modify the code in ParametrizedEulerAnglesAndTranslation::getMatrix (in Ray/rayGroup.todo.cpp) to combine the rotation matrix obtained from the constructor, with the translation, to obtain the complete 4x4 transformation matrix.</span>

            <td>(2)</td>
            <td><span>Although using Euler angles guarantees that the in-between transformations are rotations, they can result in unwanted artifacts (such as the jiggling of the runner's legs in Data/act/test.ray). To fix this problem, implement nearest rotation interpolation/approximation which finds the rotation between two rotations by computing the weighted average of the two rotations (not necessarily itself a rotation) and then finding the closest rotation to that average. 
To do this, you will need to implement the code in Matrix3D::closestRotation (in Util/geometry.todo.cpp) which returns the rotation closest to the general 3x3 transformation described by the Matrix3D object. (To help you on your way, the method Matrix3D::SVD has already been provided, giving the SVD decomposition of an arbitrary matrix as the product of a rotation, a diagonal, and another rotation matrix. The Singular Value Decomposition is performed in such a way that the absolute values of the diagonal entries in the diagonal matrix is strictly non-increasing.) 
You will also need to modify the code in ParametrizedClosestRotationAndTranslation::getMatrix (in Ray/rayGroup.todo.cpp) to combine the rotation matrix obtained from the Matrix3D::closestRotation with the translation, to obtain the complete 4x4 transformation matrix.</span><br> </td>

To do this, you will need to implement the constructor Matrix3D::Matrix3D(const Quaternion& q) (in Util/geometry.todo.cpp) which generates the matrix corresponding to a quaternion. (Keep in mind that the matrix is only a rotation if the quaternion is a unit quaternion.)

            <td><span>Implement the parametrization of rotations by the 3x3 skew-symmetric logarithm. 
To do this, you will need to implement the function Matrix3D::Exp (in Util/geometry.todo.cpp) which computes the exponential of a matrix using the first iter terms of the Taylor approximation. Keep in mind that the Taylor series for the exponential function is: 
exp(X)=1+X+X*X/(2!)+X*X*X/(3!)+...+X**k/(k!)+...

where X**k represents X raised to the k-th power, and k! is "k factorial" -- k*(k-1)*(k-2)*...*2*1. 
You will also need to modify the code in ParametrizedRotationLogarithmAndTranslation::getMatrix (in Ray/rayGroup.todo.cpp) to combine the rotation matrix obtained from exponentiation with the translation, to obtain the complete 4x4 transformation matrix.</span><br></td>

(2) Add the ability to composite two motions specified in separate .key files onto the same actor at the same time. Augment the .key files to include a #Start time, and linearly blend between motions for the subsets of joints in both .key files during transition periods. Demonstrate this feature with a hand waving motion composited onto a walking cycle.<br>
